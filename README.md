# DESIGN
I wanted to recreate my house in aframe as, like many others, I've been staying home most the time in response to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Additionally, as both my sister and mother work with Covid patients, I stay in even longer for our safety and the safety of others.

This is a rough outline of my house.
