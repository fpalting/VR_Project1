VR Project 1: Inside Out
## Demo:https://fpalting.github.io/VR_Project1/
Note that the demo is pretty taxing, ideally, you should use a pc or have a very good smartphone. Click and drag is also not functional on mobile devices.

# DESIGN
I wanted to recreate my house in aframe as, like many others, I've been staying home most the time in response to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Additionally, as both my sister and mother work with Covid patients, I stay in even longer for our safety and the safety of others.

This is a rough outline of my house.

I wanted to make it as close as possible, so I recreated the interior using aframe geometry.
# Interactions
The following are before and after images for pressing the covid mode and the light switch.
